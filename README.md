## Development Approach
1. Sketch out a wireframe.
2. Divide functionality into modules
- Render Map on screen and set user's location at the center.
- Execute API query, iterate through data and render icons for each greenspace within range.
- Populate table of addresses on the screen
- Display photo carousel
- Style the address table
- Add responsive design elements
- Distinguish between user's location and the greenspaces in range on the map.

## Installation Instructions
No special install is required but you will need an internet connection to use the application

## Unsolved Problems or Wonky Things
1.  Use of setTimeout to force a pause before the API call executes.  This ensures the location finder method completes before the API call begins.
- this may result in poor performance on slower internet connections because the pre-set timeout might not be long enough.
2.  Slower response for users outside of Brooklyn or Manhattan since the dataset returned by the API won't be filtered by borough.
